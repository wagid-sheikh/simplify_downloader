But with this version so far: A. I want Codex to perform a deep audit of the code, db stuff, variables and pipelines and the whole nine-yards. So and such that we are production ready. Prepare task list for all the fixes to be done so that we are production ready and share that task list. B. Then I will pass that task list in next codex session to complete the task. C. After A & B are done, will ask Codex to prepare detailed documentation for the entire project ignoring existing documentation in place, new AGENT.md and other industry standard documents. D. Then move to production. E. Create a new branch for further development work with Codex. Act as the needed subject matter expert and give required prompts for A. B-Will be done by me (to pass the output of A to codex) C: you prepare prompt for codex, then we work on D & E. Make you to our enough guards in prompt for step A so that existing working code does not break.
